	<p> Web developers are programmers who specialize in the development of applications 
		relating to the World Wide Web or distributed network applications. These network 
		applications typically run protocols like HTTP from a Web server to a client brower
		using associated programming languages like JavaScript, C#, Ruby and PHP - to name 
		a few.

			write codes to "tell" a website what to do or how to function. They are like 
			the directors and scriptwriters behind every movie.</p>
